# Firehose API

Firehose monitors the web in real time. You create **rules** (Lucene queries) on a
**tap**, and every crawled page that matches a rule is delivered to that tap over a
Server-Sent Events stream. (URL Watch — tracking a fixed list of pages for changes — is a
separate product; see the docs index at the end.)

This file covers the common Stream API tasks inline so you can act without fetching. For
the full Lucene field semantics, the complete category/type label lists, the validate
contract, URL Watch, and billing, follow the links under **Documentation** at the end —
that section is generated from the live docs, so it never goes stale.

## Authentication

Base URL: `https://api.firehose.com`. Bearer token, two kinds (both issued from the
Firehose dashboard):

- **Management key** (`fhm_` prefix) — create, list, update, and delete taps. Cannot manage rules or stream.
- **Tap token** (`fh_` prefix) — manage the rules on one tap and open its stream.

```
Authorization: Bearer fh_your_tap_token
```

## Endpoints

**Tap management** — management key:

| Method           | Path           | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`            | `/v1/taps`     | List taps; response includes each tap's `token` |
| `POST`           | `/v1/taps`     | Create a tap (returns its token)                |
| `GET PUT DELETE` | `/v1/taps/:id` | Get, rename, pause/resume, or delete a tap       |

To pause a tap `PUT /v1/taps/:id` with `{"status":"paused"}`; resume with `{"status":"active"}`.
A paused tap keeps its rules but matches nothing and streams no updates; resuming re-arms every
rule and can return `422` if it would exceed your plan's active-tap limit.

Deleting a tap is permanent: it immediately revokes the tap's token and deletes every rule
on it. Confirm with the user before deleting a tap — if the tap only needs to stop
temporarily, pause it.

**Rules & streaming** — tap token:

| Method           | Path            | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `GET`            | `/v1/rules`     | List the tap's rules                                         |
| `POST`           | `/v1/rules`     | Create a rule                                                |
| `GET PUT DELETE` | `/v1/rules/:id` | Get, update, or delete a rule                                |
| `POST`           | `/v1/validate`  | Validate a query before saving (`/v1/validate/public`: no auth) |
| `GET`            | `/v1/stream`    | Open the SSE stream of matching pages                        |

Deleting a rule is permanent and its matches stop immediately. Confirm with the user
before deleting rules.

## Rules & queries

A rule object has: `value` (Lucene query, required), `tag` (label, optional, ≤255 chars),
`nsfw` (bool, default `false`), and `quality` (bool, default `true` — drops pagination,
tag/category, and stale pages).

Queries use **Lucene ClassicQueryParser**. The default field is `added` (text from inserted
diff chunks). Key fields:

- **Text** (tokenized, case-insensitive): `added`, `removed`, `added_anchor`, `removed_anchor`, `title`
- **Keyword** (exact, case-sensitive): `url`, `domain`, `publish_time`, `page_category`, `page_type`, `language`
- **Number** (range queries): `dr` — Ahrefs Domain Rating 0–100
- **Filter**: `recent:<n>h|<n>d|<n>mo` — only pages published within the window

Operators: `AND` `OR` `NOT`, `"exact phrases"`, and on `url`/`domain` wildcards (`*` `?`)
and regex (`/.../`) — escape `/` as `\/` (and `\\/` in JSON). Example queries:

```
tesla AND language:en
title:tesla AND page_category:"/News" AND recent:24h
domain:techcrunch.com AND NOT url:*\/tag\/*
```

## Streaming (SSE)

`GET /v1/stream` emits four event types: `connected` (open), `update` (a match),
`error`, and `end` (timeout/limit reached — reconnect to continue). An `update`'s `data`
is `{ tap_id, query_id, matched_at, document }`, where `document` carries `url`, `title`,
`publish_time`, `diff.chunks[]` (`{ typ: "ins"|"del", text }`), `page_category[]`,
`page_types[]`, `language`, `domain_rating`, and `markdown`. Null/empty fields are omitted.

## Examples

```bash
# Create a tap (management key) — the response contains the new tap token
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIREHOSE_MANAGEMENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Brand Mentions"}' \
  https://api.firehose.com/v1/taps

# Create a rule, then list the tap's rules (tap token)
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIREHOSE_TAP_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value":"ahrefs OR semrush","tag":"seo"}' \
  https://api.firehose.com/v1/rules
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIREHOSE_TAP_TOKEN" https://api.firehose.com/v1/rules

# Open the match stream (keep the connection open)
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $FIREHOSE_TAP_TOKEN" https://api.firehose.com/v1/stream
```

## Rate limits & errors

`/v1/rules` — 60 requests/min per tap. `/v1/stream` — 30 connections/min per tap. Errors:
`401` invalid/missing token, `403` resource not in your org, `404` not found, `422`
validation error, `429` rate limit exceeded.

- [Rules & query syntax](https://docs.firehose.com/stream/rules.md): Create, read, update, and delete the queries attached to a tap — and the full query language they're written in.
- [Streaming (SSE)](https://docs.firehose.com/stream/streaming.md): Open the Server-Sent Events connection, pass the right query parameters, handle each event type, and reconnect cleanly without missing matches.
- [Match payload](https://docs.firehose.com/stream/match-payload.md): Every field on an update event and the page document it delivers, with an example payload and the full list of category and type labels to match on.

### URL Watch

- [URL Watch overview](https://docs.firehose.com/url-watch/overview.md): Track a specific list of URLs for changes on a schedule and capture the diff between crawls. When to use URL Watch over the Stream, and how it works.
- [Creating watches](https://docs.firehose.com/url-watch/creating-watches.md): Add a single URL to watch, choose how often it's crawled, preview the render, check its status, and bulk-import many URLs at once from a list.
- [Diffs & crawl history](https://docs.firehose.com/url-watch/diffs-and-history.md): Read what changed between two crawls of a watched URL, including the added and removed content, and work through the recorded crawl history.
- [Quotas & limits](https://docs.firehose.com/url-watch/quotas.md): Monthly check quotas, watched-URL caps, and the fastest crawl frequency allowed on each plan — and how Firehose behaves when a watch hits a limit.

### Dashboard

- [The live feed](https://docs.firehose.com/dashboard/feed.md): Watch matches arrive in real time in the dashboard, review them as they stream in, then save the ones that matter and export your selection for later.
- [Filters & domain lists](https://docs.firehose.com/dashboard/filters.md): Reusable query fragments and domain/URL lists you attach to taps to shape what they match — plus AI query generation.

### Organizations & Access

- [Taps](https://docs.firehose.com/organizations/taps.md): Taps are the API tokens (fh_) that own a set of rules and that you stream from. Why to keep one tap per use case, and how to create and manage them.

- [Errors & limits](https://docs.firehose.com/api-reference/errors-and-limits.md): Every HTTP status code the API returns, the per-endpoint and stream rate limits, and the error events the SSE stream sends before it closes.
- [Code examples](https://docs.firehose.com/api-reference/examples.md): End-to-end snippets for taps, rules, streaming, and URL Watch in curl, JavaScript, and Python — copy, paste, and adapt them to your own keys.

### Troubleshooting

- [Why am I not getting matches?](https://docs.firehose.com/troubleshooting/no-matches.md): The usual reasons a stream or feed stays empty — crawl coverage, url: filters, the quality filter, the recency window, a too-strict query, or no credit.
- [Stream disconnects or errors](https://docs.firehose.com/troubleshooting/stream-disconnects.md): Why a stream closes or returns 401, 402, or 429, why it can seem to skip events, and how to recover from each — including after a dropped connection.

### Resources

- [Using Firehose with AI agents](https://docs.firehose.com/resources/ai-agents.md): Feed these docs and the Firehose API to an LLM or coding agent using per-page Markdown, the whole-site llms.txt files, and the installable API skill.
